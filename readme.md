## üõ† Getting Started

Before installing pawpal - make sure you have the below installed

1. nvm - [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

2. docker - [container manger](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

3. Rush - [Mono repo version manager](https://rushjs.io/pages/intro/get_started/)

4. pnpm - [Dependency manager](https://pnpm.io/installation)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tegaadigu/pawpal.git
cd pawpal
```

## üß∞ Backend / Microservices

To get started with the microservice, ensure that your environment variable is configured using the example found in `.env.example` - otherwise run the below command to create a new `.env` from your `.env.example` file.

***Note***: This action is not reversible, if you have already filled out your .env file skip this step.

```bash
# from the root folder
# Install all micro-service dependencies
pnpm run install:services:dependencies

# Create .env file based on .env.example across micro-services.
pnpm run update:services:env

# Note: The pawpal services uses a pub/sub mechanism for distributing event across micro-services - you need to first create a shared docker network for containers to have access to kafka.

docker network create pawpal-net

# Verify that the network has been created

docker network ls | grep pawpal-net

# you should see something similar to 
# b14543fb71c5   pawpal-net                bridge    local

# Start all services with docker (datbase and micro-service)
pnpm run start:services:docker

# Run database migration for all micro services
pnpm run migrate:services
```


### Create New Microservice

to create a new backend service run the below command from the root folder

```bash
#from project root folder

pnpm run create:service
 
#follow the prompt.
# On success run the previous command for installing all micro-service dependencies
# verify that your new project exists in rush.json of the project_type (services or web)/rush.json
pnpm run update:services:env

# Install dependencies to update rush
pnpm run install:services:dependencies


# Start all services with docker (datbase and micro-service)
pnpm run start:services:docker

# This should include your new service.
```
***Note***: At the moment only restful service template is supported. Pending event-driven
